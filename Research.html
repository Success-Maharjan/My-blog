	<b>Since I had researched alot i found lots of templates for portfolio. Among them these were the best. W3 school helped me alot the layout idea which i decorated in my website is also helped by w3school. I took only the idea of the layout as it is way different from the w3school. i have created my own layout. After the layout Bootstrapmade helped me alot for gaining ideas on what to do and what not to do in our desgin. My webpage is different then all of the templates, I have created my website from my creativity i took only the ideas rather than copying them. In my website there are lots of borders,margin and rare colour combinations. I got my own photo in the homepage and the links provided in the follow me box are all my social media account. I have added google map too, with my location. Hence, i created my website which was possible due to these websites which inspired and helped me for creating my website.
