	</tr>
	<tr> <th align="left"> <h3>Technology affects people today in so many ways, both positive and negative. ... Agricultural technology allows farmers to produce more food. Medical technology gives us longer, healthier lives. Technology such as the internet and telephones helps us stay in touch with people we love. Being overly connected can cause psychological issues such as distraction, narcissism, expectation of instant gratification, and even depression. Beside affecting users' mental health, use of technology can also have negative repercussions on physical health causing vision problems, hearing loss, and neck strain. In fact it's the 'thinking' in response to our environmental experiences and interaction with our world that actually shapes our brains. ... So in short, the answer to the question, does technology change our bodies and our brains, is yes, technology affects our memory, our attention, what we focus on and our sleep cycles.<br> 
		Technology can affect life both positively and negatively. New technology always changes our life very much and takes it to a new level. It is like the new way of thinking or doing the normal things differently, better and much more faster with less hassle and at a much affordable rate. When it comes to the way we communicate, modern technology has had an impressive influence. Digital technology has also changed what people term as ‘media.’ The influence of new technology on media is apparent since a media company isn’t necessarily a news platform anymore. That’s almost half of the world’s population. Around the world, two million smartphones are sold every day. The amount of information being shared on social media networks is phenomenal. Social media isn’t the only big statement digital technology has made. Neither is social media the only way technology has had an impact in everyone’s life.
